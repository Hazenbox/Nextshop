# NextShop Inventory Management

A modern inventory management application built with React and Material Design 3 principles.

## Design System

- **Primary Color**: #3A9E00 (Green)
- **Typography**: Funnel Sans font family
- **Design System**: Material Design 3 with custom implementation

## Font Usage

This application uses Funnel Sans as its primary font. 

If you have access to Funnel Sans font files:
1. Place the font files in the `/public/fonts/` directory with the following names:
   - FunnelSans-Regular.woff2
   - FunnelSans-Regular.woff
   - FunnelSans-Medium.woff2
   - FunnelSans-Medium.woff
   - FunnelSans-Bold.woff2
