# Font Files Directory

This directory should contain Funnel Sans font files in the following format:
- FunnelSans-Regular.woff2
- FunnelSans-Regular.woff
- FunnelSans-Medium.woff2
- FunnelSans-Medium.woff
- FunnelSans-Bold.woff2
- FunnelSans-Bold.woff

To use Funnel Sans, you'll need to acquire these font files from the appropriate source and place them in this directory.

If the Funnel Sans font isn't available, the application will fall back to the Inter font which is loaded from Google Fonts as a backup.
